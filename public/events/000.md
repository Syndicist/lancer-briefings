# Smokehouse Station - MSMC Recruitment Franchise // 2.21.5014u
En route to a main MSMC installation, the squad mingled with eachother for the first time. The eccentric trio comprised of the corpro e-celebrity-turned-rouge **LACHESIS**, the failed revolutionary **DEATHCAP**, and the seedy tech junkie and massive nerd **CATCH** hit it up the station's dive bar - just about its sole attraction. There, they bonded over the bar's self-proclaimed "famous" bug cheese grilled sandwiches, and some imitation caviar of dubious origins. It was then that they recieved a notification to immediately make their way to what they discovered to be a simulation room.

There, their would-be Commanding Officer informed them that their recruitment was ordered to be expedited and their final examination was to begin immediately. It was then they undertook **The Milkrun**, the infamously grueling final test in MSMC recruitment and advancement.

**LACHESIS** acted swiftly to secure the ~~milk~~package, taking down several of its guard detail with some fire support from her team. **CATCH** kept important targets in disarray with an unconventional cyber warfare suite that, the commander noted, the station's on-board NHP had trouble scrubbing from the station's databanks completely, despite the excercise taking place in a thought-to-be contained virtual environment. **DEATHCAP**, either through luck or incredible foresight, took the brunt of enemy fire and electronic warfare attacks and quickly managed to re-secure the EZ from flanking enemy reinforcements using mining equipment she adamantly specified should be added to her mech despite initial resistance from the engineering comp-con assigned to mech printing.

Needless to say passed with an unexpected degree of proficiency, though normally the event would be semi-live-fire their ability to remain perfectly calm under pressure and completely outmaneuver and overwhelm their combat comp-con adversaries with unconventional tactics were each noted by their CO.

Having attained the recognition of their CO, and with them MSMC, they were immediately given their first assignment. Details were not forthcoming; they were told only that they would be travelling to a relatively-newly-colonized world known as **HERCYNIA** and to expect further details after departure. They were each issued LL0 Lancer Piloting Licenses and with them, the official and legally-recognized ability to print and own GMS Frames, arms and systems. Their mechs would be printed aboard the factory-shuttle they would be boarding en-route to the contract world.

With a degree of uncertainty hanging after a very successful virtual assessment, the trio travel to their assigned shuttle and wait in anticipation for further orders.
