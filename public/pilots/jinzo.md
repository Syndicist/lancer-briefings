Shayan has spent the last 7 years wandering from place to place taking work as a mercenary. His own conscience often ends up at odds with the type of work available to him and as a result he ends up working low paying jobs. With the little money he scrounges up he is able to barely manage but even so he still uses party of his earnings to fund his passion: Music.

Since childhood, music has been his respite from the worries and struggles in his life. As he grow older his fondness for music would develop into an aspiration to become an artist. With the money he saved working as a mercenary he was finally able to produce his very first album "Corrupted Mind Palace."

Upon its release the album was critically panned, some calling it the "Worst Beat Ever Created", although Shayan would frequently reject this statement proclaiming that "CMP is a light 7 at WORST." With a failed album and no money to his name, he signs a contract with The Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company in order to start saving for his next project and clear his tarnished reputation.
