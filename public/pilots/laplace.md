Being a Milesian noble and having no leviathans to slay he has, like so many other nobles of his time, Caius decided instead to take up his lance against the enemies of the Union. He brings along with him his peoples songs and their way of aerial fighting, diving down upon his foe with lance and fury before darting out of reach. Although, his peoples language might be universally understandable it doesn't mean it's good for combat to that end he has outfitted his mech with a translation ai to interpret his shortened songs to his allies common tongue. While he was going through his first training mission off-world, he ended up crashing down amidst a dense jungle and getting lost. With his cabin steadily increasing in temperature and not knowing where he was in such a bizarrely green and planty alien environment(very different from the rocky craigs of his homeworld) he started to sing for help. His shipboard ai translated his status through his damaged radio to his entire wing in a particularly verbose way. To make matters worse the "Dense Jungle" was only about a mile wide as it was in fact just a small towns forest preserve. This message gained him his callsign of LAPLACE or Lost Amid Plants Losing All Composure Exfil please. Despite that rocky start, he would go on to prove his worth.
