# Mission // #002
## Vigilant Gaze

Patience puts the colony at its maximum security level and asks the squad to be on high alert. They are asked to stay around the colony while Evergreen scouts try to predict the movements of the Hercynian raiders.  
Before anyone can gather more intel, a nighttime attack on the colony forces the team into action.

# Goals
- Defend Evergreen and protect Evergreen’s reactor.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, Evergreen’s reactors will be destroyed, forcing the colony to use backup power, demolishing its defenses and its ability to function.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
