# Mission // #000
## Milkrun
# Goals
- Prove yourself in the infamous MMC evaluation - the Milkrun.
- Retrieve a package in a high-stress environment and get to extraction.

# Stakes
- This final phase of your basic training will determine whether you make it into the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company - and your base standing therein. Pass, and the MMC will officially sponsor your Lancer License.
- For this excercise, you will be piloting virtual mechs in a simulated environment. Your would-be superiors will be evaluating as if it were live-fire, so don't get reckless.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
