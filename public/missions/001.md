# Mission // #001
## The Drop
# Goals
- Neutralize all hostiles
- Prevent civilian casualties
- Excercise discretion

# Stakes
- This might be the first battle in a very anticipated war. The VS getting embarassed by astronomical casualties in a situation where they should have captured an entire city uncontested positions the LSA favorably to regain the momentum of the conflict, while the VS just might be desperate enough to hire some new and impressive guns afterwards.

# Reserves
- None.
