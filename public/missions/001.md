# Mission // #001
## Bug Hunt
# Goals
- Stabilize the situation around Evergreen.
- Track the raiders
- Try to discover who the raiders really are
- Stop the attacks

# Stakes
- Without something done to stabilize Evergreen's surroundings, Evergreen might have to pull back further, focusing on the defense of city limits and leaving the frontier towns to fend for themselves.
- If the situation worsens, the validity of the contract might be at stake as Union determines MSMC is not holding up their end, jeopardizing your newfound position as Union-recognized Lancers.

# Reserves
- None.
